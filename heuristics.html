                        user and a computer system interact, in particular the use of input devices and
                        software. The same basics of interface design are used across user interfaces to help
                        users get to grips with things faster. It is a part of a broader user experience. A
                        design is not usable or unusable by itself. It is the features together with what the
                        user wants to do with it and the user's environment, that decide the usability.
                        User Experience (UX) - The overall experience of a person using a product such as a
                        website or computer application, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to
                        use.</p>

                                        When users know the current system status, they learn the outcome of

                                        users informed about what's happening. Imagine using a social media app

                                        finished.

                                        lack of information can be frustrating because you're left wondering if

                                        informed about what's happening with their actions, reducing frustration
